# Portfolio website

My portfolio website.

A static website built with vanilla JS & CSS.

Aim at achieving a clean & neat look while displaying some dynamic features.



---

# Installation

Just fireup any one-liner server and serve it.
Most feature should work with index.html opened locally in a browser, but svg icons will not be shown in that case.
